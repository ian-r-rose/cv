## Employment

### City of Los Angeles / Argus Associates

`2019-`
**Data Engineer/Data Scientist:** Full-time contractor with the City of Los Angeles' nascent Data Science and Predictive Analytics team. In my capacity supporting a small team of data analysts I have a number of roles:

* Developing software tooling for government data analysis work
* Deploying and maintaining cloud infrastructure for the team
* Data engineering and ETL writing
* Data analysis work around:
    * dockless mobility
    * city planning and zoning
    * homeless shelter management
    * COVID-19 response

### Quansight

`2018-2019`
**Software Engineer:** Contractor developing tools and integrations for data scientists.
Much of my work focused on improving the integration of a GPU-based relational database (OmniSci)
with the broader Python data science ecosystem.


### Berkeley Institute for Data Science

`2016-2019`
**Postdoctoral Fellow:** As a member of the Perez group
I joined the JupyterLab development team, working on features like
the third-party extension system, and real-time collaboration.
My work there also brought me into collaboration with related groups such as the
Binder team and Pangeo.

## Education

### University of California, Berkeley

`2009-2016`
**Ph.D. Earth and Planetary Science**

Thesis: *True polar wander on convecting planets*


### Yale University

`2005-2009`
**B.S. (Geology and Physics)**

## Selected software projects and contributions

### JupyterLab

JupyterLab is a next-generation front-end for Jupyter kernels.
In addition to developing the core project,
I have also helped to develop and shepherd the extension ecosystem,
including extensions for working with Dask, GitHub, Google Drive, and LaTeX.

### Interactive Earth

Interactive Earth is a piece of educational software I wrote for teaching about the physics of planetary interiors.
It simulates real-time interactive simulations of fluid and solid dynamics,
including thermal and themochemical convection and seismic wave propagation.
It is written in C++/OpenGL, deployed to the web using WebAssembly/WebGL.

### Intake ecosystem

I am a contributor to the Intake project, and author/maintainer of several intake drivers. These include drivers for GeoPandas and DCAT catalogs, which back many government open data portals.

### PostGIS-Ibis-GeoPandas integration

At the City of Los Angeles I support novice/intermediate Python data analysts who need to interact with geospatial data stored in traditional relational databases.
To that end, I contributed support for geospatial operations to the Ibis project, targeting PostGIS databases.
This allows the user to write pythonic, pandas-like expressions which generate SQL to query the database.
This allows for a smooth transition from large, possibly cloud-based vector geospatial data to an in-memory GeoDataFrame.

## Technical Skills

### Programming languages
C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, OpenGL

### Computational methods
PyData stack, GIS analysis, visualization and mapping, ordinary/partial differential equations, statistical modeling and inference, Monte Carlo methods

### Web development
React, webpack, node/npm, Vega/VegaLite, WebGL, Leaflet, asynchonous and event-driven programming
